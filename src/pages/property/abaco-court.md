The theme of this vacation house is clear, blue, refreshing water. The beach is just a short walk away. Your private heated pool and hot tub are just few steps away. The house is nestled above a canal, so you’ll even go to sleep to the sound of gently lapping water.

This 2000 square foot waterfront house, with rear exposure to the south, sleeps eight, with one king bed, one queen, two twins, and two bathrooms. It also comes with a two-car garage. It was furnished under the theory that there’s no such thing as too much comfort. The bright and airy white-tiled kitchen is lit up by the morning sun. It comes with all the amenities, from a refrigerator and stove to a microwave and coffee maker. And of course no Marco Island kitchen is complete without a blender so you can enjoy the sunset with your tropical blended drinks.

But where will you enjoy the sunset, that’s the question. Sitting on your dock (boat lift not for use), feet dangling in the warm water? Or maybe out on your own private lanai, in your hot tub? The weather here is so perfect you may not want to go inside for a while. That’s why the lanai comes with a gas grill.

The rustic, sea-inspired décor of the living room and bedrooms is designed to make your stay as peaceful as it is luxurious. Air conditioning cools you down after a day in the sun. The house comes with cable and free wi-fi so you can sit back on the sofa and watch a movie on your television. Or go online to plan the next day’s adventures.

Marco Island is famous for having every fun-filled activity under the Florida sun. Take a short walk from your house to the miniature golf course. Charter a fishing boat. Go on a shelling trip. Or how about taking a jet ski tour of the Everglades with Captain Ron? You can also go parasailing, windsurfing, kayaking or paddle boarding. The activities never end and neither does the fun.

Shopping and entertainment adventures are also just a short walk from your house at the open-air Marco Walk Plaza, where you’ll find specialty shops, salons, spas and plenty of fine dining options to make your day complete.

The crystal clear water here is so inviting. It’s inviting you to come enjoy the vacation of your life at this jewel of a vacation house in Marco Island.
