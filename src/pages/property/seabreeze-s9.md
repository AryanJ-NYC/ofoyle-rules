Welcome to a romantic setting in the tropics. This 500 square foot, 2nd floor condo sleeps two, with one king bed, a sleeper sofa, and one bathroom.

The building is nestled away in lush gardens filled with palm trees, colorful ferns, and fragrant hibiscus bushes. The interior of the unit takes its design cues from the surrounding beach, with coral-hued tile floors, palm blade ceiling fan, and colorful seascapes on walls the color of the silken white sands. The tropical sun brightens the rooms with natural light, creating the feeling of island-style tranquility as you relax on the cozy sofas or enjoy some entertainment on the wall-mounted television.

The summer kitchen features formica countertops and all the modern appliances and cookware you need to cook up a special dinner or blend tropical drinks to sip as the setting sun casts palm tree shadows on the gardens below.

The bedroom is tastefully designed with ocean-blue walls and wicker furnishings for the utmost in comfort. It also comes with a wall-mounted televison along with plenty of closet and drawer space.

The unit is filled with amenities for your comfort and convenience, including air conditioning and heating, Free Wi-Fi, and cable. You’ve also got everything you need for a day at the beach, like a beach umbrella, beach chairs and cooler.

So put on a pair of flip-flops and make the short walk to the turquoise waters and unforgettable sunsets of Resident’s Beach, where you can purchase a pass for access to beach activities, dining at the shaded tables of Paradise Grill, picnic chickees with charcoal grills, and concerts on the green.

The Paradise Coast offers every activity under the sun, from wading in warm tide pools, collecting shells, to snorkeling with sea turtles and fish.

You can also enjoy yourself without leaving the Seabreeze South. Swim in the heated pool then use one of the gas grills to barbeque a poolside lunch. Play a game of shuffleboard. Or enjoy the daily activities in the social room.

There’s no better way to celebrate another perfect day in paradise than dinner at one of the Island’s favorite restaurants, like NeNe’s, Doreen’s Cup of Joe, or Joey’s Pizza, all just a short walk away.

So for a romantic vacation as perfect as the Marco Island weather, plan your trip to the Seabreeze South today.
