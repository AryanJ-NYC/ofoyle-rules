Your ticket to paradise is just a short drive from Ft. Myers, Florida, Regional Southwest Airport. At Apollo on the Beach Condo, unit 208, you'll have your own private, premiere over-sized balcony with southwest exposure, providing an unobstructed view of Marco Island's beautiful 3 1/2 mile white sand crescent beach. Unit 208 is a one bedroom/bath, WiFi, new tile, new furniture, and two flat screens/DVD TVs. The kitchen is fully equipped with a newer refrigerator, stove, dishwasher and microwave. The Sunset Grille, voted 'best happy hour' on the island, is located on the ground floor. The Apollo is the only condo on Marco Beach that allows weekly rentals with the convenience of a restaurant on the premises!



You'll find excellent restaurants in Marco and Goodland, a unique near-by fishing village. The Marco Movie Theatre serves food while you're viewing the latest movie. Many restaurants will prepare your fresh catch. Rose Marina offers boat rentals for cruising or fishing, a narrated lunch or dinner cruise around the island and Key West Excursions. For relaxation, soak up the sun with a good book or go shelling while walking on the beach. If your daily routine includes exercise, then try the Apollo exercise room, rent a bike, scooter or wave runner, putt around on a near-by golf course, snorkel or dive, jet-ski or parasail. For less strenuous activity, visit the Immokalee Casino, take a helicopter ride or plane ride, or enjoy the many island shops and the Outlet Mall north of Marco. Nature lovers should check out Rookery Bay, and tour the Everglades in an air boat or swamp buggy or relax on a beautiful double decker boat to see the local flora and fauna. Don't forget the free two mile boardwalk on your return trip! The Naples Philharmonic and the Barbara B. Mann Center for the Arts offer the best in quality entertainment.
