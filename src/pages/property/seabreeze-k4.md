Welcome to a quiet, peaceful community that surrounds you with amenities. This 500 square foot condo sleeps four, with one king bed, one sleeper sofa, and one bathroom. The sun-brightened interior creates a feel of island style living at its best. Seaside images fill the rooms, from the coral-hued tile to wicker chairs to decorative seashells, just like the ones you’ll find in the warm tide pools when you make that short walk from the condo to the beach.

The summer kitchen comes with all the modern appliances and cookware you need to prepare everything from a romantic dinner to a batch of tropical blended drinks to sip as the sun goes down.

The bedroom features a wall-mounted television and a desk, along with plenty of closet space. Fragrant ocean breezes through the windows will fill your dreams with the warm sands and turquoise water that await you in the morning.

Think of all the comforts and conveniences of home and chances are you’ll find them here, from Free Wi-Fi and cable to air conditioning and ceiling fans. You’ve also got beach essentials like an umbrella, beach chairs and a cooler.

Here at the Seabreeze South, there are countless ways to relax. Take a refreshing swim in the heated pool then lie back on a palm-shaded sun lounger or use one of the gas grills to cook up a poolside barbeque. After lunch, how about a game of shuffleboard? Or you can participate in one of the many community events in the social room.

Just a short walk away, the sparking water of Resident’s Beach beckons. You can purchase a pass for access to beach activities, dining at the shaded tables of Paradise Grill, and concerts on the green. Take a parasailing cruise and see the ocean the way the birds see it. Charter a fishing boat or go snorkeling alongside colorful tropical fish. If total relaxation is more your style, lay back on beaches of sugar white sand watching dolphins frolic in the surf.

There’s no better way to cap off a day at the beach than dinner at one of Marco Island’s favorite restaurants, like NeNe’s, Doreen’s Cup of Joe, Joey’s Pizza or Fin Bistro, all just a short walk from the unit.

With so many deluxe amenities such a short walk from the beach, the Seabreeze South is the tropical paradise you’ve always dreamed about.
